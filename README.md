# texty_v2

This is an updated version of Texty, completely rewritten using websockets and Angular 4.1. This is under active development. I will soon post a video and a written tutorial on creating this app and get it up to working condition.

The backend and the frontend are completely different and can be run individually in the same or different machines after making the necessary minor changes.
